My name is Robert Kingan; I am a software developer and data scientist (depending on the day of the week) at Bloomberg LP in New York City.

### More Information

My LinkedIn profile has a pretty thorough career history, but in a nutshell, I have a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Louisiana State University, where my concentration was in
algebraic number theory, and over the years I've worked in a variety of industrial settings, getting to play with data problems in emergency management, health care,
signals intelligence, traffic data management and currently legal document analysis.
