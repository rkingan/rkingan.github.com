Welcome to my blog! My name is Robert Kingan; I am a software developer and data scientist (depending on the day of the week) at Bloomberg LP in New York City.

My plan for this blog is to share posts about data science, data engineering, machine learning engineering as well as observations on collaboration in data science and software engineering.
